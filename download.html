            <h2>Student Center v5.16.29</h2>
            <p><strong>App Description:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Student Center is a comprehensive and user-friendly application designed specifically for students. The app offers five main features: Notepad, Exam Analysis, Assignment Tracker, Internet Explorer, and Media Player, supporting both local and online media. While Exam Analysis is currently in its alpha phase, the other features are fully functional.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Assignment Tracker helps manage assignments by their due dates, providing reminders to ensure timely submission. Notifications are sent on the due date at 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 5:00 PM, ensuring that users are reminded to submit their assignments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aware that students frequently use their smartphones, the Internet Explorer feature allows them to seamlessly browse the web when connected to the internet. The app aims to be a valuable tool for students, and future updates will introduce additional features.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I strive for stability, some features may experience issues. Please report any problems you encounter, including details about the actions leading to the issue. I appreciate your feedback and will work to resolve these issues in future updates. Enjoy the various features of the app and help me improve Student Center for everyone!
