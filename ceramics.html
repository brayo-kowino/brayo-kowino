            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ceramics are non-metallic, inorganic materials that are widely used due to their unique properties. They play an important role in various industries, from construction to technology.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This research is currently in progress. Complete details will be provided soon.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="recycling">
            <h2>Recycling of Ceramics</h2>
            <p>The recycling of ceramics presents both challenges and opportunities. While not widely practiced, ongoing innovations are aiming to improve the recyclability of ceramic materials.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Research in progress. More information will be posted soon.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="uses">
            <h2>Uses of Ceramics</h2>
            <p>Ceramics are used in a wide range of industries, including construction, healthcare, and technology. Their durability and heat resistance make them ideal for both everyday and advanced applications.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Full details are being compiled and will be posted soon.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="substantial">
            <h2>Substantials</h2>
            <p>The production and use of ceramics contribute significantly to the global economy, particularly in manufacturing, healthcare, and technology sectors. However, sustainability and resource management are key concerns.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This section is under development. Complete insights will be shared in due time.</p>
